* ~nix-tools~

~nix-tools~ is a set of haskell to nix tools to integrate haskell
projects into nix build environements.

* Motivation

Why (yet) another conversion to nix?  ~cabal2nix~ has served the nix
community well for a long time.  It does have short comings that can't
be easily overcome without significantly altering ~cabal2nix~.  These
are among others:

- hard coded flags / operating system upon invocation
- package resolution in cabal2nix instead of nix.

Ideally we'd convert cabal files into nix expression and retain almost
everything from the cabal file and let nix deal with the expression
afterwards.

~nix-tools~ explores this space of a very simple ~.cabal~ conversion
into a ~nix~ expression and then doing the lifting in nix.
